                <p style="font-size: 1.1em; color: #555; line-height: 1.6;">
                    During my time in the <strong>Manufacturing Data Science (MDS)</strong> department, I was deeply
                    immersed in the
                    fascinating world of data analytics and machine learning. My primary assignment was to contribute to
                    the
                    <strong>Materials Efficiency Project</strong>, where I was entrusted with pivotal tasks that shaped
                    the project's
                    trajectory. My journey began with meticulous data preparation and engaging in Exploratory Data
                    Analysis (EDA). This
                    initial phase was crucial as it allowed me to delve into the structure of thte data, identify
                    quality issues, and select
                    features that would drive model performance.

                <p style="font-size: 1.1em; color: #555; line-height: 1.6;">
                    Armed with Python and SQL, I not only learned to manipulate and analyze data but also became adept
                    at
                    creating robust data pipelines. Using the <strong>Dataiku</strong> platform, I designed and
                    implemented ETL
                    processes that ensured seamless data integration. My involvement in bi-weekly meetings with
                    colleagues was
                    equally significant, fostering collaboration and alignment within the project team.

                    One of the highlights of my internship was the focus on <strong>Material Efficiency</strong>. This
                    project
                    aimed to tackle challenges such as wastage and over-consumption of materials within the
                    manufacturing
                    process. Through data exploration, I was able to uncover patterns and identify opportunities for
                    optimization that could lead to significant cost savings. The culmination of this work involved
                    predictive
                    modeling to forecast future material usage, ensuring proactive planning for resource management. A
                    significant aspect of this process was
                    the creation of a robust data pipeline to facilitate seamless data flow. <strong>See the photo below
                        for
                        example.</strong>

                    Another fascinating aspect of my role involved <strong>Parts Cropping</strong>, a vital task in a
                    broader
                    initiative aimed at detecting anomalies in dies produced through image processing. This process
                    required
                    meticulous attention to detail, as I developed algorithms to crop images accurately, ensuring they
                    were
                    centered and ready for analysis.
